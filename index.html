          <p>openENGR [<em>Open Engineering</em>] is an initiative to promote the practice of openness in the engineering field. We are working towards increased awareness of open practices as well as providing tools to better enable engineers to be more open.</p>

          <h4>engrXiv</h4>
          <p>engrXiv (Engineering Archive) is the eprint server for engineering. Dedicated to the dissemination of engineering knowledge quickly and efficiently, engrXiv is partnered with the <a href="http://cos.io/">Center for Open Science</a> to build a free, open access, open source archive for engineering research and design. The initiative responds to growing recognition of the need for faster, open sharing of research and design on a truly open access platform for all engineering disciplines. Papers on engrXiv will be permanently available and free to the public. <a href="http://blog.engrxiv.org/2016/07/announcement">Learn more.</a></p>

          <h4>The Journal of Open Engineering</h4>
          <p><b>The Journal of Open Engineering</b> is a fee-free, open-access, peer-reviewed journal targeting all fields and applications of engineering. Through a partnership with <a href="http://www.pubpub.org/">PubPub</a>, the journal is attempting to push the boundaries of openness in the field of engineering and in the landscape of engineering publishing. The PubPub platform is an online authoring system which provides a modern, open authoring and review workflow. The platform allows for authors, reviewers, and editors to complete the publishing workflow completely online with no need to track different versions of files and navigate a confusing document handling process. All revisions are stored online and all reviews are conducted in the open. This helps reduce the overhead costs of managing the editorial process since the online system takes care of rendering the manuscript for public consumption. <a href="http://www.tjoe.org/about">Learn more.</a></p>
